RECON's activities are made possible by its members, who often volunteer time
and effort for the greater good, but also by funding bodies and partners who
have been supporting the organisation since its early days. On this page, we
acknowledge institutions who supported RECON in terms of:

* *direct funding*: these funders support RECON through direct donations to the
  organisation, or free/discounted services

* *indirect funding*: these funders support RECON through means other than
  direct donations, typically through salaries of members who contribute to
  RECON activities through their professional activity, or financial support of
  events
  
* *partners*: these are organisations which have been collaborating with RECON
  to co-organise events such as workshops and short courses

## Indirect funding

### MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis (MRC GIDA)

Based at Imperial College London and headed by 
[Pr Neil Ferguson](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/neil.ferguson), 
[MRC GIDA](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis/about-us/) 
(MR/R015600/1) has played a key role supporting the emergence of RECON and its
activities, by helping us fund various events and supporting salaries of several
key members. In particular, it provided the core funding for
[Hackout 3](http://hackout3.ropensci.org/), which led to
the creation of RECON, as well as for our first meeting on outbreak analytics in
[March 2018](https://recon-gathering-march2018.netlify.com/).



### NIHR Health Protection Research Unit for Modelling Methodology (NIHR HPRU MM)

A structural collaboration between Public Health England and Imperial College
London, the [NIHR HPRU MM](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/hpru-modelling)
(HPRU-2012-10080) has been established in 2014 with the aim of developing novel
analytical and computational tools to improve public health. It has supported
events, activities and members salaries since the emergence of RECON. In
particular, it funded most of our short course in
[Sofia](https://recon-sofia-2018.netlify.com/) and the satelite 
[short course](https://recon-malta-2018.netlify.com/) and
[workshop](https://recon-hackfest-3.netlify.com/) for the ESCAIDE conference in
Malta in 2018.



### UK Public Health Rapid Support Team (UK-PHRST)

The [UK-PHRST](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/UKPHRST) is a unique collaboration
between Public Health England and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical
Medicine to provide and coordinate the UK’s public health response to outbreaks
in low- and middle-income countries. In addition to the public health response,
the UK-PHRST conducts outbreak-related research and capacity building for
outbreak response. The UK-PHRST is financed through UK Official Development
Assistance funding and supports RECON primarily through salary support of some
members and meeting sponsorship.
