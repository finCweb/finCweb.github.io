## How can I join the RECON community?

There are two ways to join our community, corresponding to different degrees of
involvement:

- as a *subscriber* following our activities, by signing up to our 
[mailing list](https://mailman.ic.ac.uk/mailman/listinfo/recon-forum) 
and getting involved in discussions on our
[Slack organisation](https://reconhub.slack.com)

- as a *member*, who actively contributes to the development of analytics
  resources for RECON's areas of interest; this is typically more involved but
  also offers advantages reserved to members; see the *Becoming a member*
  section below

## Becoming a member

### Who are our members?

[Our members](../people) form the backbone of RECON. They are actively involved in the
development of analytics tools, contribute free and open training material, run
our workshops, teach at our short courses, or are deployed to the field where
they battle-test our resources to inform the response to disease outbreaks,
health emergencies, and humanitarian crises. Through votes at our annual General
Assembly, they can shape activities of RECON, and are also elligible for roles
in the Executive Board. 


### Why become a member?

Members benefit from a number of advantages; they can:

- attend general assemblies to shape the activities of RECON

- advertise their work, when in line with the remit of RECON, on the association
  media, including newsletters, mailing lists, discussion forums, blogs and
  websites
- possess a confidential list of other RECON members to facilitate networking
  within the association
- attend meetings not otherwise open to the public, such as internal training
  workshops, hackathons and retreats organised by the association

  equipment)

Benefits to members are formally defined in *Article 5.4* of our

### How to become a member?

RECON aims to gather a community of people actively involved in the development
of free analytics resources to inform the response to disease outbreaks, health
emergencies, and humanitarian crises. Beyond the development of analytics tools,
this also includes people contributing to training and capacity building, and
people battle-testing our resources in the field.


Anyone can apply to become a *regular member* of RECON, in order to be involved in
RECON projects and events. *Contributing members* need to have made a contribution
in any of the areas of RECON activities including software development, training
and capacity building, or field deployment. See 
[our statutes](https://www.repidemicsconsortium.org/documents/statutes_en_1.2.pdf) 
for more details on contributions; below is a quick summary:

- *software development*: you made a substantial contribution to RECON packages
  (hosted at https://github.com/reconhub), either through new functions, new
  automated tests, documented datasets, or by contributing new documentation
  
- *training and capacity building*: you contributed training material,
  typically on https://reconlearn.org, taught at one of our short courses, or
  co-organised a RECON workshop or a similar event using RECON materials

  country* to respond to a disease outbreak, a health emergency, or a
  humanitarian crisis
