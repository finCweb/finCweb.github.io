# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in the RECON community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, actual or perceived sexual identity and orientation, gender identity and expression, or sex characteristics. We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include (but are not limited to):

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or
  advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email
  address, without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all RECON community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing RECON. 

Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event (such as RECON training activities) or when on deployments as a RECON member. 

Individuals participating (either as a trainer or as a participant and irrespetive of RECON member status) in RECON events such as workshops or training events will be required to sign a copy of the Code of Conduct upon registering to attend the event 

## Reporting Guidelines
Instances of behaviour that is abusive, harassing or otherwise unacceptable may be reported to the RECON Code of Conduct Committee, which will be comprised of 2 board members and 1 external, independent individual. Whilst these individuals are being recruited, Charlie Whittaker (charles.whittaker16@imperial.ac.uk) and Claire Thompson (claire.thomson@alumni.manchester.ac.uk) will form a temporary Code of Conduct committee. 

If you experience or witness unacceptable behaviour or have any other concerns, please submit a report to the Committee as soon as possible using this form: <https://forms.gle/BQ48fSENVGo2bnAX7> - the information in this form will go to all three Committee members. Alternatively, you may email <repidemicsconsortium.complaints@gmail.com> or contact a member of the Committee directly to make a report - either via email or the RECON Slack Channel. If any member of the Committee has a conflict of interest with a report, they will be recused and will not have access to the content or process of the report follow-up. 

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly - the Code of Conduct Committee will investigate and decide an appropriate response to reports with the aim of making a decision as soon as is reasonably possible. This decision will then be communicated to RECON's Executive Board as a recommendation for action. The RECON Executive Board will then vote on accepting the recommendation. If passed, the Executive Board will be responsible for enforcing the recommendation for action as stipulated by the Code of Conduct Committee. Any Board members involved in the complaint will be recused and will be unable to cast a vote or attend the meeting where the matter is voted on. Throughout the process, members of the Code of Conduct Committee and the RECON Executive Board are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident. Additionally, the email address <repidemicsconsortium.complaints@gmail.com> is protected by 2FA and a password known only to members of the Code of Conduct Committee. The Code of Conduct Committee will not communicate the identity of the reporter to the Board unless given express permission to do so by the complainant. 

## Enforcement Guidelines
Members of the Code of Conduct Committee will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior,  harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the RECON community.

**Note:** In addition to punishments relating to an individual's wider position within the RECON community as described above, where appropriate, the Code of Conduct committee also reserve the right to recommend targeted sanctions addressing specific aspects of an individual's engagement with RECON to the Executive Board, such as a ban from being a trainer or participant at RECON workshop or training events.
