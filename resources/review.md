This document provides guidelines for package review which are meant to promote
clearer, robust, maintainable, and well-documented code. It borrows largely
from the [*rOpenSci* onboarding
guidelines](https://github.com/ropensci/onboarding/) and from [this
post](http://discourse.repidemicsconsortium.org/t/scoring-system-for-r-packages/31/2)
on the RECON forum. See [list of contributors](#credits) for more information
on people who shaped this.






## Package review guidelines

- run [*goodpractice*](https://github.com/MangoTheCat/goodpractice/) to detect possible issues.

- go through the [*rOpenSci* checklist](https://ropensci.github.io/dev_guide/reviewtemplate.html)

adopted, the following people contributed to these guidelines; in alphabetic
order:
