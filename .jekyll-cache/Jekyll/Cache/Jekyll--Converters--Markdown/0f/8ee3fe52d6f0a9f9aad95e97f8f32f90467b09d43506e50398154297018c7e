<h3 id="what-is-slack">What is slack?</h3>

<p><a href="https://slack.com/"><em>Slack</em></a> is a free instant messaging application running on multiple platforms, including mobile phones. It is ideal for short discussions which do not need archiving. Whether it is to ask methodological questions, get some help with <strong>R</strong>, coordinate meetings or developments, to announce an event, or for social purposes. This is the best place to interact virtually with our community.</p>

<h3 id="what-to-use-it-for">What to use it for?</h3>

<p>Slack is designed for chats and interactive discussions; it will be your go-to for most topics such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>getting general help with <strong>R</strong></li>
  <li>getting help on a specific data analysis</li>
  <li>discussing methods and statistics</li>
  <li>discussing events such as conferences and workshops</li>
  <li>coordinating social events</li>
  <li>getting together a working group on a topic of your choice</li>
</ul>
